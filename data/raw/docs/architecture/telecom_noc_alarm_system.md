# NexaTel NOC Alarm Correlation and Alerting System
## Document ID: ARCH-NOC-001 | Version: 2.1 | Owner: NOC Operations SRE Lead (Deepak Nair)

### 1. OVERVIEW
This document details the configuration and operations of the QoS Alarm Correlation Engine (SVC-NOC-001) and Major Incident Bridge (SVC-NOC-002). These services manage real-time alert aggregation, alarm correlation, auto-ticketing, and incident response dispatch.

SVC-NOC-001 and SVC-NOC-002 are Tier 0 services. Any malfunction in the alerting path delays incident response, leading to extended MTTR and SLA penalties.

### 2. ALARM CORRELATION ENGINE
The QoS Alarm Correlation Engine aggregates event streams from Prometheus, Grafana, and network switches. The engine uses temporal and topology-based rules to group related alarms:
- **`Temporal Correlation`**: Groups alerts from the same service occurring within a 5-minute sliding window.
- **`Topology Correlation`**: Maps alarms based on dependency links (e.g., if SVC-AUTH-001 fails, downstream warnings are grouped as child alerts under the primary incident).

### 3. ALARM SEVERITY LEVELS
Alarms are classified into four severity levels:
- **`CRITICAL`**: Complete service loss on Tier 0 or Tier 1 components.
- **`MAJOR`**: Degraded performance or high latency impacting > 1% of subscribers.
- **`WARNING`**: Threshold breaches with no immediate subscriber impact (e.g., high CPU).
- **`INFORMATIONAL`**: Standard logs (deployments, backups).

### 4. AUTO-INCIDENT CREATION RULES
If an alarm with `alarm_severity=CRITICAL` is detected on a Tier 0 service:
1. **ServiceNow Sync**: Automatically creates a Major Incident record (INC-YYYY-NNNN) in ServiceNow within 30 seconds.
2. **Support Ticket Ingestion**: Automatically creates a corresponding entry in `PROD_TICKETS`.
3. **Emergency Notification**: Pages the on-call SRE lead (e.g., Suresh Iyer for auth).
The entire flow executes in under 60 seconds from the trigger timestamp.

### 5. AUTO-PAGING CONFIGURATION
Auto-paging is managed by integrating the engine with Asterion's on-call rotation schedules. Pages are dispatched via SMS, phone call, and email based on the escalation matrix.

### 6. GRAFANA INTEGRATION
Operational dashboards reside in the centralized Grafana repository. Dashboards must follow the standardized naming convention:
`https://monitoring.asterion.example/nexatel/dashboards/[service-name]-prod`

Example dashboard paths:
- Identity Broker: `https://monitoring.asterion.example/nexatel/dashboards/identity-broker-prod`
- SIM Activation: `https://monitoring.asterion.example/nexatel/dashboards/sim-activation-prod`

### 7. ALARM SUPPRESSION (MAINTENANCE WINDOWS)
- **Suppression Rule**: Alerts for services undergoing scheduled changes within approved maintenance windows (`MW-YYYY-MM-NNN`) are suppressed to avoid false incidents.
- **Cooldown Lift**: Normal alerting policies resume automatically 15 minutes after the scheduled maintenance window closes.

    E -->|Yes| F[Auto-Create Incident & Page SRE]
    E -->|No| G[Log and Monitor]
    F --> H[Launch P1 Bridge SVC-NOC-002]
```

### 8. SRE ON-CALL INTEGRATION
On-call rosters are pulled from CRM caches hourly. The team lead remains accountable for incident triage until a handover is logged.

### 9. P1 BRIDGE AUTO-LAUNCH
When a P1 incident is auto-created:
1. **Bridge Launch**: Major Incident Bridge (SVC-NOC-002) initializes a virtual bridge call.
2. **Page Participants**: Invites the Major Incident Manager (Arjun Mehta), NOC Bridge Lead (Lakshmi Narayanan), and SRE Leads from the affected domains.
3. **Customer Alert**: Dispatches a notification to NexaTel Service Delivery Manager (Rajesh Venkatraman).
4. **SLA Monitor**: Starts a 30-minute timer for the resolution target.

### 10. ALARM THRESHOLDS
Threshold configurations (must match `policy_logging_monitoring.pdf` specifications):
- **Identity Broker (SVC-AUTH-001)**: Trigger alarm if `ERR_AUTH_401` exceeds 50 events/hour.
- **eSIM Orchestrator (SVC-PROV-002)**: Trigger alarm if `ERR_ESIM_504` exceeds 20 events/hour.
- **Mediation (SVC-MED-001)**: Trigger alarm if processing latency exceeds 2,000ms.

## API SPECIFICATION
| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Request Payload | Response Body | Status Codes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v2/noc/alarm/trigger` | `{"alarm_id": "string", "source_element": "string", "severity": "CRITICAL", "message": "string"}` | `{"status": "Correlated", "incident_id": "INC-string"}` | `200`, `400`, `401` |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/noc/alarm/active` | `None` | `{"active_alarms": [{"alarm_id": "string", "severity": "string", "triggered_at": "string"}]}` | `200`, `403` |

## NFR/SLO/SLI TABLE
| Metric Name | SLO Target | SLI Measurement Method | Downstream Impact on SLA |
|---|---|---|---|
| Correlation Duration | < 500ms | NOC correlation engine timer | Delays major outage detection and SRE notification |
| Deduplication Rate | > 95% | Alarm input vs output counts | Dashboard flooding during network outages |
| Alert Delivery Time | < 1 second | Log timestamps for SRE pages | Breaches mean time to detect (MTTD) targets |

## STRIDE THREAT MODEL
- **Spoofing**: Require API validation tokens for all network element alert transmitters.
- **Tampering**: Encrypt alarm configuration databases and rulesets using system credentials.
- **Repudiation**: Record SRE bridge team logins and alerts acknowledgements in immutable audit database.
- **Information Disclosure**: Do not expose internal IP addresses of affected backend nodes in alerts.
- **Denial of Service**: Enforce stream throttle rate limit of 15,000 alarms/sec.
- **Elevation of Privilege**: restrict NOC dashboard manual alert clears to Level 3 SRE Leads only.

## CAPACITY MODEL
- **Peak Throughput**: 25,000 raw alarms/second processing during major fiber-cut scenarios.
- **Memory Footprint**: 12GB RAM to support real-time rule correlation matrices in-memory.
- **Autoscaling**: Triggers pod scale-out when CPU load remains above 75% for 2 minutes.

## OPERATIONAL RUNBOOK
1. **Health Verification**: Call `/noc/health` and verify Prometheus alerts pipeline connectivity.
2. **Log Verification**: Audit `/var/log/nexatel/noc_alarm.log` for database lock errors.
3. **Failover Procedure**: Promote secondary correlation engine replica to primary if heartbeats timeout.
