# NexaTel Digital KYC Integration Architecture
## Document ID: ARCH-KYC-001 | Version: 2.3 | Owner: KYC SRE Lead (Kiran Kumar)

### 1. OVERVIEW
This document details the integration design, failover strategies, and regulatory compliance rules for the Digital KYC Adapter (SVC-KYC-001). This service validates subscriber identities against government records before activation.

SVC-KYC-001 is a Tier 1 service. Government policies require KYC approval before SIM activation, meaning any KYC outage blocks subscriber provisioning.

### 2. KYC ADAPTER ARCHITECTURE
The Digital KYC Adapter wraps external verification APIs and provides a secure REST API:
- **`Document Ingestor`**: Receives customer IDs, photo scans, and metadata.
- **`Vendor Router`**: Manages API calls and payload transformations between active verification vendors.
- **`Risk Assessor`**: Compiles scores from third-party risk analysis engines.
- **`Audit Recorder`**: Stores hashed transactions to satisfy compliance tracking.

### 3. VENDOR INTEGRATION
To guarantee system availability, SVC-KYC-001 operates a dual-vendor configuration:
- **Primary Vendor**: VerifyNow Ltd. (REST API, SLA 99.9% availability).
- **Failover Vendor (v2.7.0+)**: TrustID Solutions Pte Ltd. (REST API, SLA 99.5% availability).
- **Failover Logic**: The adapter automatically routes new requests to TrustID if VerifyNow fails to respond or returns gateway errors for 60 consecutive seconds.
- **Compliance**: Both vendors hold ISO 27001 certifications and maintain signed data processing agreements.

### 4. DOCUMENT VERIFICATION FLOW
1. Subscriber uploads documents via Mobile Self-Care Backend (SVC-SELF-001) or a partner dealer portal.
2. SVC-KYC-001 validates file formats and metadata.
3. Request is dispatched to the active vendor API.
4. The vendor validates the document and returns a confidence score.
5. If the confidence score matches the threshold, a validation token is issued.

### 5. RISK SCORING
Subscribers are assigned a fraud risk score. Scores exceeding the risk limit are flagged for manual verification by the fraud operations team (SVC-FRAUD-001).

### 6. OFFLINE QUEUE MODE
If both vendors are unreachable, the adapter transitions to offline queue mode. Onboarding files are queued locally, and subscribers are provisioned in "restricted service mode" (voice and domestic SMS only). The queue is processed once vendor APIs return to normal.

### 7. DATA RESIDENCY AND COMPLIANCE
To comply with local regulations (India's DPDP Act 2023 and the UAE's PDPL), subscriber document scans must not leave regional bounds. Document files are stored within local databases, and external APIs receive only encrypted hashes for matching.

### 8. ERROR CODES
Troubleshooting index:

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Description | Action | Runbook Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ERR_KYC_503** | 503 | Primary and failover KYC vendors are unreachable. | Check internet connectivity, vendor health, and verify if offline queue is active. | [KYC Outage Runbook](https://runbooks.asterion.example/nexatel/kyc/incident-response) |
| **ERR_KYC_422** | 422 | Document verification failed (low confidence, scan corrupt). | Instruct subscriber to submit a clearer scan. | [KYC Outage Runbook](https://runbooks.asterion.example/nexatel/kyc/incident-response) |

### 9. MONITORING
Grafana dashboard: [KYC Verification Dashboard](https://monitoring.asterion.example/nexatel/dashboards/kyc-adapter-prod)

Alerts:
- **`kyc_primary_vendor_down`**: Fired if VerifyNow API fails for 60 seconds (triggers auto-failover).
- **`kyc_verification_rejection_spike`**: Fired if verification failures exceed 15% of total requests.

### 10. HISTORICAL CONTEXT
- **VerifyNow Ltd. Infrastructure Outage (August 2023 — INC-2023-0058)**:
  - **Symptom**: Complete failure of KYC verification requests. Onboarding blocked, causing ticket `TICKET-100310`.
  - **Root Cause**: Primary vendor VerifyNow suffered a 6-hour infrastructure outage. Because no secondary vendor was configured, all KYC calls failed with `ERR_KYC_503`.
  - **Resolution**: Implemented emergency change `CHG-2023-08-006` to enable offline queueing. 847 subscribers were onboarded in restricted mode. Long-term fix (`PRB-2023-0009`) was deployed in release `v2.7.0` (`CHG-2023-10-008`), integrating TrustID as the secondary failover vendor.

## API SPECIFICATION
| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Request Payload | Response Body | Status Codes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v2/kyc/verify` | `{"national_id": "string", "id_type": "string", "document_image_b64": "string"}` | `{"kyc_status": "Approved", "match_confidence": 0.98}` | `200`, `400`, `422`, `503` |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/kyc/status/{id}` | `None` | `{"verification_id": "string", "status": "Pending", "last_updated": "string"}` | `200`, `404` |

## NFR/SLO/SLI TABLE
| Metric Name | SLO Target | SLI Measurement Method | Downstream Impact on SLA |
|---|---|---|---|
| Verification Latency | < 3s (P95) | API request timestamp logging | Delays customer onboarding and order generation |
| Image Processing Success | > 99.5% | OCR verification engine logs | Manual backlogs on operations team |
| Government DB Timeout | < 1.5s | HTTP client timeout logs | Service degradation during registration |

## STRIDE THREAT MODEL
- **Spoofing**: Enforce public certificate key validation for government API connections.
- **Tampering**: Encrypt document images in transit and store using envelope encryption.
- **Repudiation**: Keep immutable audit logs of all ID verification decisions and approval codes.
- **Information Disclosure**: Mask all PII data in logs and secure transient files folders on server.
- **Denial of Service**: Enforce rate limits (max 50 onboarding calls per client token per minute).
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Limit access to raw customer ID documents to the compliance officer role.

## CAPACITY MODEL
- **Verification Peak**: 500 KYC submissions/minute during holiday onboarding campaigns.
- **Network Bandwidth**: 100 Mbps dedicated link to external government verification systems.
- **Storage Profile**: Temporarily retains raw document scans for 48 hours max before deletion.

## OPERATIONAL RUNBOOK
1. **Health Verification**: Call `/kyc/health` and verify external API endpoints status.
2. **Log Verification**: Audit `/var/log/nexatel/kyc_verify.log` for any external API timeout warnings.
3. **Failover Procedure**: Route verification calls to backup government verification endpoint if primary fails.

## TECHNICAL DEBT REGISTER
- **Tech Debt ID**: TD-KYC-002
- **Component**: Document Parser
- **Description**: Legacy OCR module version 1.2 frequently fails to parse blurry images.
- **Business Impact**: Manual KYC approval queue grows, delaying activations.
- **Remediation Plan**: Upgrade to machine learning based layout parser in next major maintenance release.
